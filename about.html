						<h3>Glasswap Origin Story</h3>
						<p>At the age of 7, I started to have Nearsightedness, everything that cannot be reached by my hand became blurry in my eyes. The cruelty of Nearsightedness is that in the early stage, one does not know until he or she is told. One year later, I started to wear glasses. I didn’t know that was a life-long decision. The frame I chose was all black acetate for durability concerns. However, after only six months, my doctor suggested me to change because my nearsightedness had gotten more severe. I said maybe I could keep the frame and simply replace the lens, but the doctor talked me into having a second pair as a backup just in case. There was no other choice, I purchased another pair, both lens and frame. It cost me, I mean parents, around $600. My second pair was a half-rimmed titanium frame with a thicker lens.</p>
          				<p>When I finished primary school, I got my third pair and started wondering if I could get rid of the first one and get some of my money back so that I could buy some games. Unfortunately, no one would accept the used lenses and the frame was only worth about $10. </p>
						<p>At the age of 18, I decided to study abroad in the U.S. By that time I had 5 pairs of eyeglasses. One day, the one I was wearing got hit and broke a leg during a soccer game. It was 3 days before my departure: there was no time to get a new prescription and purchase a new pair. I tried to look for alternatives, even considered one of my dad’s. Only if there was a place I could get a pair that matched my prescription. And that was when I got the idea of Glasswap. </p>
